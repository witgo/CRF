Relase 1.3
----------
The third release includes:
- BSegment/BSegmentCRF having implementation of ICML 2006 paper 'Efficient inference on sequence segmentation models' by Sunita Sarawagi
- Bug fixes, lots of performance improvements
- New features in Model package


Release 1.2 
-----------
The second release mostly includes a bunch of changes for improving performance, 
and a set of new features.

The important changes are:

a) A new version of semi-CRF that allows dataset to specify candidate segments 
   instead of always evaluating all possible segment sizes from 1 to M. Refer
   SegmentCRF.java this change.
b) Support for a large number of sparse labels (classes) along with a sparse 
   set of features (refer SparseCRF.java).
c) Support for pairwise constraints on labels assigned during inference by Viterbi. 
d) Caching of logSumExp calculations to remove the bottlenecks of the massive 
   number of log/exp functions.

e) Constructor change in FeatureTypes to allow more than one CRF object at a time. 
   Instead of an object of the Model class, the FeatureTypes constructor now 
   accepts a FeatureGenerator object. This is a major design change, as all 
   the Features created by extending FeatureTypes class has to be modified for 
   this version. 

f) Support for serilizability for learned models.

g) A set of new features

	1) ClassPriorFeature.java      
		Encodes prior probability of class labels.
	2) FeatureTypesConcat.java
		Concatenates token features over a segment (subsequence of tokens).		
	3) ConcatRegexFeatures.java     
		Regular expression based features for a segment.
	4) RegexCountFeatures.java
		Encodes count of a pattern in a segment of tokens.
	5) FeatureTypesEachLabel.java
		A wrapper for features on input token sequence. Such features are
		fired for all class labels once they are wrapped inside this class.
	6) WindowFeatures.java
		A wrapper for token features, which can specify a window of tokens
		in or around the current token (segment) to be used to generate
		features for the current token (segment).
	7) FeatureTypesPosition.java
		To encode relative position of labels within a sequence.
	8) FeatureTypesSegmentLength.java & FeatureTypesSegmentLengthPoly2.java  
		To encode lengths of segments with a small number of new feature ids.
	9) FeatureTypesWrapper.java
		A wrapper for another feature types for backward compatibility.
